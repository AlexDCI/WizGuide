# Project README

## Overview

This is a web application under development, built using Django and Python, that functions as a **translator** with integrated **AI-powered support from GPT-4**. The app allows users to upload documents or images, add comments or questions, and translate text seamlessly.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents (e.g., PDFs, Word files) for translation or querying.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images containing text, and the app will extract and translate the text.
- **GPT-4 Integration**: The app leverages GPT-4 to provide intelligent translation, as well as the ability to answer user questions or add comments to the uploaded content.
- **Text Translation**: Translate text directly by pasting it into the provided field.
- **Comments and Questions**: Users can add comments or ask questions about the content to get relevant answers powered by GPT-4.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for backend development.
- **GPT-4**: OpenAI's language model used for advanced translations and intelligent responses.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: For extracting text from images to be translated or queried.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 4.x or higher
- OpenAI API key for GPT-4 integration
- Tesseract (for OCR functionality) installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git
    cd projectname
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:

    - Add your **OpenAI API key** to the `.env` file:

      ```
      OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
      ```

    - Set up **Tesseract** for OCR by specifying the installation path in your environment variables.

5. Apply database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. Create a superuser for the admin interface (optional):

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Your application should now be running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

- **Upload a Document**: Navigate to the upload section of the app, select a document to upload, and it will be processed for translation or querying.
- **Upload an Image**: Upload an image with text, and the app will extract the text and perform translation or answer any queries related to the text.
- **Translate Text**: Paste the text you want to translate and select the desired language.
- **Ask Questions**: Add your comments or ask questions about the content, and the AI will respond.

## Future Features

- Multi-language support for document and image translation.
- Enhanced AI capabilities for better contextual understanding and more accurate translations.
- Integration with third-party translation APIs.
- Real-time chat with GPT-4 for document review.
